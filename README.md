## RFEC Academy

**RFEC Academy** is a community-driven mentorship initiative focused on helping developers grow through hands-on learning, real-world projects, and guided collaboration.

The project connects mentors and mentees in structured learning tracks (Frontend and Backend), combining foundational knowledge with modern technologies such as **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Express**. Participants work together to build practical applications, improve their technical skills, and develop good engineering practices.

The goal of RFEC Academy is to create a collaborative environment where learning is continuous, practical, and accessible—empowering developers to evolve faster and with purpose.
